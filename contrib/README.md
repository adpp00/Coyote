# Coyote contributions
This folder contains implementations of contributions to the Coyote code-base that arent' part of core Coyote. Such implementations can range from fully functional to reference points, as they haven't always been updated to the latest version of Coyote. 

Currently, this folder holds an older implementation which allowed Coyote v1 to be used from virtual machines (VMs); such functionality has not been tested with Coyote v2 and is unlikely to work out of the box.
